## Diagnosing chest conditions with CNNs
Problem Statement
The diagnosis of chest conditions typically requires the use of medical imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) or X-ray scans. CT scans are favored over X-ray scans because of their ability to produce high-fidelity 3D images with multiple X-ray scans from various angles. However, cost differences between the two techniques are significant. CT scans are approximately 10x the cost of X-ray scans. This project seeks solutions to accurately diagnose chest conditions based on lower-cost X-rays.

The National Institute of Health's (NIH) chest X-rays dataset will be used, which consists of more than 100k labeled chest X-ray images. Deep learning techniques like traditional (densely connected) and convolutional neural networks will be explored.
